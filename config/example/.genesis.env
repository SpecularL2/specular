# This dotenv contains the env variables for:
# 1. generating a new genesis from a base via `sbin/create_genesis.sh`.
# 2. contract deployment, e.g. via `sbin/start_l1.sh`.
# This file is optional; it is only necessary for new deployments
# (i.e. where the genesis isn't already generated and the
# contracts must be deployed).

# Path to the base (source) genesis. Optional.
# Required only if you want to run `sbin/create_genesis.sh`.
BASE_GENESIS_PATH=./base_genesis.json
# Path to the actual (target) genesis.
# Does not need to exist at configuration-time.
GENESIS_PATH=./genesis.json
# Path to the base rollup config. Optional.
# Required only if you want to run `sbin/create_genesis.sh`.
BASE_ROLLUP_CFG_PATH=./base_sp_rollup.json
# Path to the actual (target) rollup config.
# Does not need to exist at configuration-time.
# Note: file name must start with "sp_" to support Magi.
ROLLUP_CFG_PATH=./sp_rollup.json
# L1 network parameters.
# What network to deploy to (using hardhat). Optional.
# Required only by `sbin/deploy_l1_contracts.sh`.
L1_NETWORK=localhost
# What software stack to use to run the L1 network. Optional.
# Required only by `sbin/start_l1.sh`. Options: [geth|hardhat]
L1_STACK=geth
# L1 endpoint.
# Required only by `sbin/start_l1.sh` and `sbin/create_genesis.sh`
# Note: if L1_STACK=hardhat, use host 127.0.0.1 (local) or 0.0.0.0 (docker)
L1_ENDPOINT=ws://172.17.0.1:8545
